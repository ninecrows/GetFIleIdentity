# GetFIleIdentity
Small command line program to retrieve the unique file identifier for a given file (volume serial number and file identifier).

In the process of adding in a very small JSON generator/parser implementation so that I can play with a local stdin/stdout remote control implementation to allow C# and Java code to call this for information rather than building PInvoke/JNI code to get at the API. I expect this will take a little while to pull together as this is a low priority side project.
